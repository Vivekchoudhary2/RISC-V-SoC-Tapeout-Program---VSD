# ðŸ“˜ System on Chip (SoC)

## ðŸ”¹ What is a System on Chip (SoC)?
A **System on Chip (SoC)** is the integration of complex functionalities onto a **single silicon chip**.  

Instead of using discrete multiple chips for CPU, memory, I/O, specialized processors and connecting them onto a PCB, a SoC consolidates them into one compact package. This makes SoCs **highly efficient**, **cost-effective**, and well-suited for **embedded systems** and **mobile devices**.

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform
To better understand SoC, letâ€™s look at the **Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform**.  

This single silicon chip consists of various modules/parts that perform specialized functions:  

1. **Wi-Fi Module** â€“ Enables wireless connectivity to networks.  
2. **Hexagon DSP** â€“ Provides faster processing of audio and video signals.  
3. **Qualcomm Haven Security Module** â€“ Enhances device security through advanced encryption and secure data handling.  
4. **Other Integrated Components** â€“ CPU, GPU, modem, memory controllers, and more.  

Each of this part performs different functions but, are all integrated onto a single chip.
