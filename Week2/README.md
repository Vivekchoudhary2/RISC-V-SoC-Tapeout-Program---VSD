# üìò System on Chip (SoC)

## üîπ What is a System on Chip (SoC)?
A **System on Chip (SoC)** is the integration of complex functionalities onto a **single silicon chip**.  

Instead of using discrete multiple chips for CPU, memory, I/O, specialized processors and connecting them onto a PCB, a SoC consolidates them into one compact package.

## üîπ Example: Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform
To better understand SoC, let‚Äôs look at the **Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform**.  

This single silicon chip consists of various modules/parts that perform specialized functions:  

1. **Wi-Fi Module** ‚Äì Enables wireless connectivity to networks.  
2. **Hexagon DSP** ‚Äì Provides faster processing of audio and video signals.  
3. **Qualcomm Haven Security Module** ‚Äì Enhances device security through advanced encryption and secure data handling.  
4. **Other Integrated Components** ‚Äì CPU, GPU, modem, memory controllers, and more.  

Each of these parts performs different functions but, are all integrated onto a single chip.  

It is an entire system on a chip.

# üçº Understanding VSDBabySoC: A Beginner's Guide to its Core Components

## üìñ Introduction: Your First Step into System on Chip (SoC) Design
The **VSDBabySoC** serves as a perfect starting point for learning **System on Chip (SoC) design** because it simplifies a complex system down to its three most essential functions:  
- **Processing**  
- **Timing**  
- **Real-world communication**  

It integrates three fundamental, open-source components into a compact SoC, allowing learners to see how essential **digital and analog parts** work together.

This document will break down each of these three building blocks:  
- **The Brain (RVMYTH)**  
- **The Pacemaker (PLL)**  
- **The Translator (DAC)**  

to reveal how they collaborate to create a functioning system.

---

## üß† 1. The Brain: RVMYTH (The RISC-V CPU)
RVMYTH is the **central processing unit (CPU)** or the "brain" of the BabySoC. Its main function is to **execute instructions** and **manage the flow of data** through the system by communicating with the other components.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 2. The Pacemaker: The Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)

### 2.1 What is the PLL's Primary Job?
The **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** acts as the system‚Äôs **pacemaker**. It generates a **stable, synchronized clock signal**, ensuring all components (CPU, DAC, etc.) work in harmony and avoid timing errors.

---

<details>
<summary>üîπ Why an On-Chip Clock is Essential</summary>

| Problem with Off-Chip Clocks | How the On-Chip PLL Solves It |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Clock Distribution Delays**: Signals weaken and get delayed over long wires. | Generates the clock locally, right where it‚Äôs needed. |
| **Clock Jitter**: Random timing variations cause synchronization errors. | Produces a stable, locked signal with minimal jitter. |
| **Different Frequency Needs**: Components may require different speeds. | Can multiply frequencies (e.g., 8x PLL generates 8√ó reference input). |
| **Crystal Frequency Deviations**: External crystals drift with age/temperature. | Provides an internal stable reference, correcting deviations. |

</details>

<summary>üîπ Inside the PLL</summary>

A typical PLL consists of three main parts working in a feedback loop:  
- **Phase Detector**: Compares input and output signals to generate an error signal.  
- **Loop Filter**: Processes the error signal into a stable control voltage.  
- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**: Adjusts its output to match the reference signal.  

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>üîπ Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Operation</summary>

The basic concept of a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is simple: it synchronizes the output frequency of an oscillator with the frequency of a reference signal by continuously comparing their phases and adjusting accordingly.

---

#### üîë Key Components
- **Phase Detector (PD)** ‚Äì Outputs a voltage proportional to the phase difference between the reference signal and the oscillator signal.  
- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)** ‚Äì Adjusts its frequency (increases or decreases) based on the applied control voltage in a nearly linear fashion.  
- **Loop Filter (LF)** ‚Äì A low-pass filter that smooths the error signal from the phase detector, removing unwanted high-frequency components.

Within a phase detector, the phase of the input signal and reference signal is compared and a resulting difference or error voltage is produced. This error signal passes through a low-pass filter which removes any high-frequency elements of the signal. Once through the filter, the error signal is applied to the VCO as its tuning voltage.

So, when the output from the phase detector is passed to the loop filter and when that filtered signal is applied to the VCO, the VCO generates a corresponding error signal (voltage signal) trying to match the phase of the input signal to the reference signal by either increasing or decreasing the frequency of the input signal.

Initially, there will be some difference in phase between the two signals or in other words, the loop will be out of lock and the error voltage will pull the frequency of the VCO towards that of the reference, until it cannot reduce the error any further and the loop is locked.

A steady error voltage is produced indicating a constant phase difference between the input and reference signal. As the phase between these two signals is not changing, it means that the two signals are on exactly the same frequency.

## üéµ 3. The Translator: The Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

### 3.1 What is the DAC's Primary Job?
The **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** converts **digital values** (0s and 1s) into **analog signals** that real-world devices (like speakers, displays, or sensors) can use.  
It does this by recognizing that each digit, or **bit**, in a binary number has a specific *weight* based on its position.  
This bit weight is calculated using powers of 2 (**2‚Åø**), where **n** is counted from right to left starting at 0:

- **Bit 0 (rightmost):** Weight = 2‚Å∞ = 1  
- **Bit 1:** Weight = 2¬π = 2  
- **Bit 2:** Weight = 2¬≤ = 4  
- **Bit 3:** Weight = 2¬≥ = 8

### 3.2 The DAC in VSDBabySoC
In the VSDBabySoC design, we are utilizing a 10-bit DAC, which means it can take a digital input represented by 10 bits and convert it into an analog output.

### 3.3 How DACs are Built
DACs are commonly implemented using two methods:

<summary>üîπ Weighted Resistor DAC</summary>

The weighted resistor method utilizes the summing operational amplifier circuit. The summing amplifier adds the input signals with different gains corresponding to their resistors.
