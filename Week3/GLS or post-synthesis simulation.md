# POST-SYNTHESIS SIMULATION

### What is GLS?

Simulating the code against testbench is called pre-synthesis simulation, while simulatiing the synthesized hardware against testbench is called post-synthesis simulation or gate-level simulation (GLS). The difference is clear; the RTL code has been synthesized and mapped to hardware with the help of *liberty* file.

The output of synthesis process is a *.v* file *(also called netlist file)* describing all connections in structural manner (structural as in structural coding technique used while describing a Verilog module). The logic of netlist stays same and therefore the same testbench can be used for verification.

As you can see in the image below, at top it says *"Generated by Yosys..."*, it means that RTL code has been synthesized.

### Purpose of GLS:

Gate-level simulation is used to verify the functional correctness of the synthesized hardware. It is different from the pre-synthesis simulation. GLS works on the neetlist generated post synthesis.
